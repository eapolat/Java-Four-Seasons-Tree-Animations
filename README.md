# Java-Four-Seasons-Tree-Animations
A Java program featuring four distinct tree animations, each portraying visual characteristics associated with a specific season.

There are buttons for user to choose which season the user want to see. In spring, there is just a normal tree without apples. In summer, the color of the leaves and grass get lighter green and the apples occur on the tree. In fall, both the leaves and grass get a brown color and there is a wind which vibrates the tree. Lastly, in winter the wind rises and so vibration gets higher, also all of the leaves are gone. 

This is a good practice program to see how to draw and make changings in the drawing by input, using GUI in Java. Program includes a lot of examples to see how fillRect, fillPolygon, fillOval, getColor and setColor methods work. Also it includes actionListener and Timer.

Possible further updates: Adding a snowfall to the winter tree.

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
